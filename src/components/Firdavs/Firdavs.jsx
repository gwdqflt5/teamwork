        <p>
          The term supra is a Latin word meaning "above" or "beyond" and is
          primarily used in formal, legal, or academic contexts. It serves as a
          reference tool to direct readers to previously mentioned content,
          helping maintain the flow of information without unnecessary
          repetition. It can be employed both as an adjective and an adverb.
